## Article: [AI in Healthcare](https://www.foreseemed.com/artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare)
This article talks about the many ways AI is changing everything, and one of the less expected fields is healthcare. AI is changing medical diagnosis and treatment. AI systems can analyze vast amounts of medical data – patient records, images, genetic info – to find patterns and make predictions that no human doctor could see. This could improve diagnosis, personalize treatment plans and even predict disease outbreaks. For example, AI algorithms are already being used to detect cancers from medical images with the same or better precision than human radiologists. This means earlier detection, better treatments and ultimately better patient outcomes.

After reading this article, I'm interested how AI might shift the dynamic between patients and healthcare providers in the future. If the AI becomes more integrated into healthcare, patients and healthcare providers may become too reliant on these technologies, which could lead to a loss of trust in human expertise. If an AI system makes a mistake or gives a diagnosis that contradicts a doctor’s opinion, it could create confusion and skepticism in patients. And the “black box” nature of many AI algorithms, where the decision-making process is not transparent, can be a cause of distrust. Patients may not accept a diagnosis or treatment recommendation if they don’t understand how the AI got to that conclusion. I believe we need transparency and clear communication about the role of AI in healthcare so it complements, not undermines, the trust between patients and providers.

## Comment made by Sherry Liu:
Another interesting point in this article is that it emphasizes how AI is transforming healthcare by enabling earlier and more accurate disease detection, such as identifying rare genetic disorders through advanced pattern recognition, which improves patient outcomes. I believe this is crucial for enhancing overall health and quality of life for people.
